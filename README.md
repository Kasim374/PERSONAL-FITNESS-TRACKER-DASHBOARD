# PERSONAL-FITNESS-TRACKER-DASHBOARD

Project Overview
I built this project for my practical exam to help fitness enthusiasts track their workouts. It uses Python and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to manage activity logs and show progress through charts.

-Features I Implemented
Activity Logging: Users can enter their exercise type, how long they worked out, and calories burned.
Data Validation: I added logic to make sure nobody enters negative numbers for time or calories.
Smart Analysis: Used NumPy to find the average calories burned and total time spent exercising.
Grouping & Filtering: The system can group activities by type and filter them to find specific workouts.
Visuals: I used Matplotlib and Seaborn to make 4 different charts (Bar, Line, Pie, and Heatmap).

-Files in this Project
fitness_tracker.py: This is the main Python code containing the FitnessTracker class.
fitness_activities.csv: The dataset where all my workout info is stored.
README.md: This file with instructions.

How to run it
Make sure you have pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn installed.
Keep the .py file and the .csv file in the same folder.
Run the script using: python fitness_tracker.py
